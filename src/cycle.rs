//! Cycle handling
//!
//! Salsa's default cycle handling is quite simple: if we encounter a cycle (that is, if we attempt
//! to execute a query that is already on the active query stack), we panic.
//!
//! By setting `cycle_fn` and `cycle_initial` arguments to `salsa::tracked`, queries can opt-in to
//! fixed-point iteration instead.
//!
//! We call the query which triggers the cycle (that is, the query that is already on the stack
//! when it is called again) the "cycle head". The cycle head is responsible for managing iteration
//! of the cycle. When a cycle is encountered, if the cycle head has `cycle_fn` and `cycle_initial`
//! set, it will call the `cycle_initial` function to generate an "empty" or "initial" value for
//! fixed-point iteration, which will be returned to its caller. Then each query in the cycle will
//! compute a value normally, but every computed value will track the head(s) of the cycles it is
//! part of. Every query's "cycle heads" are the union of all the cycle heads of all the queries it
//! depends on. A memoized query result with cycle heads is called a "provisional value".
//!
//! For example, if `qa` calls `qb`, and `qb` calls `qc`, and `qc` calls `qa`, then `qa` will call
//! its `cycle_initial` function to get an initial value, and return that as its result to `qc`,
//! marked with `qa` as cycle head. `qc` will compute its own provisional result based on that, and
//! return to `qb` a result also marked with `qa` as cycle head. `qb` will similarly compute and
//! return a provisional value back to `qa`.
//!
//! When a query observes that it has just computed a result which contains itself as a cycle head,
//! it recognizes that it is responsible for resolving this cycle and calls its `cycle_fn` to
//! decide how to do so. The `cycle_fn` function is passed the provisional value just computed for
//! that query and the count of iterations so far, and must return either
//! `CycleRecoveryAction::Iterate` (which signals that the cycle head should re-iterate the cycle),
//! or `CycleRecoveryAction::Fallback` (which signals that the cycle head should replace its
//! computed value with the given fallback value).
//!
//! If the cycle head ever observes that the provisional value it just recomputed is the same as
//! the provisional value from the previous iteration, the cycle has converged. The cycle head will
//! mark that value as final (by removing itself as cycle head) and return it.
//!
//! Other queries in the cycle will still have provisional values recorded, but those values should
//! now also be considered final! We don't eagerly walk the entire cycle to mark them final.
//! Instead, we wait until the next time that provisional value is read, and then we check if all
//! of its cycle heads have a final result, in which case it, too, can be marked final. (This is
//! implemented in `shallow_verify_memo` and `validate_provisional`.)
//!
//! If the `cycle_fn` returns a fallback value, the cycle head will replace its provisional value
//! with that fallback, and then iterate the cycle one more time. A fallback value is expected to
//! result in a stable, converged cycle. If it does not (that is, if the result of another
//! iteration of the cycle is not the same as the fallback value), we'll panic.
//!
//! In nested cycle cases, the inner cycle head will iterate until its own cycle is resolved, but
//! the "final" value it then returns will still be provisional on the outer cycle head. The outer
//! cycle head may then iterate, which may result in a new set of iterations on the inner cycle,
//! for each iteration of the outer cycle.
