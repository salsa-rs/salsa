/// This type is to [`MemoIngredientIndex`] what [`IngredientIndices`] is to [`IngredientIndex`]:

/// so we need to keep track of them.
///
/// This acts a map from [`IngredientIndex`] to [`MemoIngredientIndex`] but implemented
/// via a slice for fast lookups, trading memory for speed. With these changes, lookups are `O(1)`
/// instead of `O(n)`.
///
/// A database tends to have few ingredients (i), less function ingredients and even less
/// function ingredients targeting `#[derive(Supertype)]` enums (e).
/// While this is bounded as `O(i * e)` memory usage, the average case is significantly smaller: a
/// function ingredient targeting enums only stores a slice whose length corresponds to the largest
/// ingredient index's _value_. For example, if we have the ingredient indices `[2, 6, 17]`, then we
/// will allocate a slice whose length is `17 + 1`.
///
/// Assuming a heavy example scenario of 1000 ingredients (500 of which are function ingredients, 100
/// of which are enum targeting functions) this would come out to a maximum possibly memory usage of
/// 4bytes * 1000 * 100 ~= 0.38MB which is negligible.
