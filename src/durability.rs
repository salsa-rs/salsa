/// Describes how likely a value is to change—how "durable" it is.
///
/// By default, inputs have `Durability::LOW` and interned values have
/// `Durability::HIGH`. But inputs can be explicitly set with other
/// durabilities.
///
/// We use durabilities to optimize the work of "revalidating" a query
/// after some input has changed. Ordinarily, in a new revision,
/// queries have to trace all their inputs back to the base inputs to
/// determine if any of those inputs have changed. But if we know that
/// the only changes were to inputs of low durability (the common
/// case), and we know that the query only used inputs of medium
/// durability or higher, then we can skip that enumeration.
///
/// Typically, one assigns low durabilities to inputs that the user is
/// frequently editing. Medium or high durabilities are used for
/// configuration, the source from library crates, or other things
/// that are unlikely to be edited.
